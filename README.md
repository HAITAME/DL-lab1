## Overview

During this project, we addressed two main tasks: regression and multi-class classification. In the regression task, the goal was to predict stock prices using a deep neural network implemented with PyTorch. 
The multi-class classification task involved a comprehensive analysis of a manufacturing process dataset, including data preprocessing, EDA, model development, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.




## Part One: Regression

In the first part, we implemented a deep neural network to predict stock prices. The notebook `DL_lab1_part1.ipynb` details the data preprocessing, model development, hyperparameter tuning, and visualizations.

## Part Two: Multi-Class Classification

The second part involves multi-class classification on a manufacturing process dataset. The notebook `DL_lab1_part2.ipynb` covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development, hyperparameter tuning  , and performance evaluation.

## Results and Visualizations

Visualizations of loss and accuracy over epochs are available in the respective notebooks. The project also calculates metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, and F1 score for both training and test datasets.

## Conclusion

Throughout the project, valuable insights and skills were gained, including proficiency in PyTorch, effective model development, and rigorous evaluation techniques.
